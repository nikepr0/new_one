#To create a class, use the keyword class:

#You can delete objects by using the del keyword:
#del p1 

#Create three objects from the MyClass class:
"""p1 = MyClass()
p2 = MyClass()
p3 = MyClass()

print(p1.x)
print(p2.x)
print(p3.x) 
"""


#class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting #an error.
#Example
class Person:
  pass
