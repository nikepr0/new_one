"""The LEGB Rule

Python follows the LEGB rule when looking up variable names, and searches for them in this order:

    Local - Inside the current function
    Enclosing - Inside enclosing functions (from inner to outer)
    Global - At the top level of the module
    Built-in - In Python's built-in namespace
